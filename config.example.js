   // The use of the Github API in Pulldasher is slightly unconventional.
   // Rather than using a token for the currently-logged-in user to access the
   // API, we use one token belonging to the organization for everyone. This is
   // driven by Pulldasher's back-end/front-end separation. Because the backend
   // has to be able to access the API even when noone is logged into the front
   // end, it can't use the users' tokens. The user logins are used only for
   // determining permissions and the active user.
   //
   // To use Pulldasher, you'll need to set up the following on GitHub:
   // 1. A GitHub Application for your organization
   // 2. An API key that has access to the repo you're going to track
   // 3. A GitHub webhook on the repo you want to monitor

      // Where GitHub will send the user's browser after authentication
      callbackURL:  'http://localhost:' + port + '/auth/github/callback',
      // An API token for the backend to make API requests with
      token:        "oauth api token for server-side api calls",

      // the repo Pulldasher is going to monitor.
